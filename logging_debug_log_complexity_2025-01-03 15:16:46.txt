Game Board and Rules:\n   - Create a 10x10 grid-based game board.\n   - Define three types of resources: Gold, Wood, and Stone.\n   - Implement the following unit types:\n     - Worker: Collects resources from adjacent tiles.\n     - Warrior: Attacks opponent units.\n     - Builder: Constructs buildings.\n   - Define building types:\n     - Base: Stores resources and spawns new units.\n     - Barracks: Spawns Warriors.\n     - Outpost: Expands player control.\n   - Set the win conditions:\n     - Accumulate a predefined amount of each resource.\n     - Eliminate all opponent bases.\n\n2. AI Player Implementation:\n   - Create three levels of AI:\n     - Beginner: Makes random but valid moves.\n     - Intermediate: Uses heuristics to prioritize resource collection and basic defense.\n     - Advanced: Implements strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n3. Turn-Based Logic:\n   - Implement a turn-based system allowing each player to perform actions in sequence.\n   - Validate and execute player actions: move units, collect resources, attack opponents, or build structures.\n\n4. Dynamic Decision Making:\n   - The AI players should adapt their strategies dynamically based on the current game state, including opponent moves.\n\n5. Performance Evaluation:\n   - Run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes, decision-making processes, and overall performance for each AI.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The game may be text-based or include a simple visualization (optional).\n- Include error handling and validation to ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\nTest Success Criteria:\n- Functional game logic with turn-based mechanics.\n- AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n- Advanced AI demonstrates dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n- All winning conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\''}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 200}}

Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to achieve the objectives outlined in the task:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Game Environment\n1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system (preferably version 3.7 or above).\n2. **Create a Project Directory**: Set up a directory for your project files (e.g., `ResourceWars`).\n3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Optionally, set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.\n\n### Step 2: Define Game Board and Rules\n1. **Create the Game Board**:\n   - Define a 10x10 grid using a 2D list in Python.\n   - Each tile can hold resources and units.\n   \n   ```python\n   board = [[None for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Define Resource Types**:\n   -

Define a 10x10 grid using a 2D list in Python. - Each tile can hold resources and units. ```python board = [[None for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)] ``` 2. **Define Resource Types**: - Create a class or dictionary to represent resources (Gold, Wood, Stone). ```python resources = {\'Gold\': 0, \'Wood\': 0, \'Stone\': 0} ``` 3. **Implement Unit Types**: - Create classes for `Worker`, `Warrior`, and `Builder` with attributes for health, position, and methods for their actions. ```python class Unit: def __init__(self, unit_type, position): self.unit_type = unit_type self.position = position self.health = 100 # Example health class Worker(Unit): def collect_resources(self): # Logic for collecting resources pass ``` 4. **Define Building Types**: - Create classes for `Base`, `Barracks`, and `Outpost` with methods for their functionalities. ```python class Base: def __init__(self, position): self.position = position self.resources = {\'Gold\': 0, \'Wood\': 0, \'Stone\': 0} ``` 5. **Set Win Conditions**: - Implement a function to check win conditions based on resource accumulation or elimination of opponent bases. ### Step 3: Implement AI Player Levels 1. **Beginner AI**: - Implement random movement logic for the beginner AI. ```python import random def beginner_ai(): # Randomly select a valid move pass ``` 2. **Intermediate AI**: - Use heuristics to prioritize actions like resource collection and defense. ```python def intermediate_ai(): # Evaluate the board and make decisions based on heuristics pass ``` 3. **Advanced AI**: - Implement strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). ```python def advanced_ai(): # Implement MCTS or minimax algorithm pass ``` ### Step 4: Implement Turn-Based Logic 1. **Create a Game Loop**: - Implement a loop that allows players to take turns, validating and executing their actions. ```python def game_loop(): while not game_over: for player in players: # Player action execution pass ``` 2. **Validate Player Actions**: - Ensure that actions are valid (e.g., movement within bounds, sufficient resources for building). ```python def validate_action(action): # Check if the action is valid pass ``` ### Step 5: Dynamic Decision Making 1. **Adapt AI Strategies**: - Implement logic for AI to adapt based on the current game state and opponent actions. ```python def adapt_ai_strategy(current_state): # Analyze the state and adjust AI strategy pass ``` ### Step 6: Performance Evaluation 1. **Simulated Matches**: - Create a function to run matches between AI players of different levels and log results. ```python def simulate_matches(num_matches): for _ in range(num_matches): # Run a match and log outcomes pass ``` 2. **Log Decision-Making Processes**: - Implement logging to capture AI decisions and outcomes for analysis. ```python import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) ``` ### Step 7: Testing and Validation 1. **Test Game Logic**: - Verify that the game logic works as intended, including turn-based mechanics and win conditions. 2. **Test AI Behavior**: - Ensure that AI players behave according to their defined strategies and adapt dynamically. 3. **Error Handling**: - Implement error handling to manage unexpected inputs or actions gracefully. ### Step 8: Optional Visualization 1. **Text-Based Interface**: - Implement a simple text interface to display the game state and allow player input. 2. **Simple Visualization**: - Optionally use libraries like Pygame or Tkinter for a graphical interface. ### Step 9: Final Review and Deployment 1. **Review Code**: - Go through the code for optimization and readability. 2. **Deploy**: - Package the game if necessary and share it with others for playtesting. By following this structured plan, you can systematically develop the "Resource Wars" game as per the requirements and ensure that all aspects of the game are implemented correctly.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 14814, 'n': 1, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'schema': {'$defs': {'PlanStep': {'description': 'PlanStep model for representing a step in a plan.', 'properties': {'step_number': {'title': 'Step Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'step_name': {'title': 'Step Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_description': {'title': 'Step Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_explanation': {'title': 'Step Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_output': {'title': 'Step Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_full_text': {'title': 'Step Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['step_number', 'step_name', 'step_description', 'step_explanation', 'step_output', 'step_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'PlanStep', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'Subtask': {'description': 'Subtask model for representing a subtask in a step of a plan or another subtask.', 'properties': {'subtask_number': {'title': 'Subtask Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'subtask_description': {'title': 'Subtask Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_name': {'title': 'Subtask Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_explanation': {'title': 'Subtask Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_output': {'title': 'Subtask Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_full_text': {'title': 'Subtask Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['subtask_number', 'subtask_description', 'subtask_name', 'subtask_explanation', 'subtask_output', 'subtask_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'Subtask', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'description': 'Plan model for representing a step-by-step plan.', 'properties': {'steps': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/PlanStep'}, 'title': 'Steps', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['steps'], 'title': 'Plan', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'name': 'Plan', 'strict': True}}, 'stop': None, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Implement random movement logic for the beginner AI. ```python import random def beginner_ai(): # Randomly select a valid move pass ``` 2. **Intermediate AI**: - Use heuristics to prioritize actions like resource collection and defense. ```python def intermediate_ai(): # Evaluate the board and make decisions based on heuristics pass ``` 3. **Advanced AI**: - Implement strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). ```python def advanced_ai(): # Implement MCTS or minimax algorithm pass ``` ### Step 4: Implement Turn-Based Logic 1. **Create a Game Loop**: - Implement a loop that allows players to take turns, validating and executing their actions. ```python def game_loop(): while not game_over: for player in players: # Player action execution pass ``` 2. **Validate Player Actions**: - Ensure that actions are valid (e.g., movement within bounds, sufficient resources for building). ```python def validate_action(action): # Check if the action is valid pass ``` ### Step 5: Dynamic Decision Making 1. **Adapt AI Strategies**: - Implement logic for AI to adapt based on the current game state and opponent actions. ```python def adapt_ai_strategy(current_state): # Analyze the state and adjust AI strategy pass ``` ### Step 6: Performance Evaluation 1. **Simulated Matches**: - Create a function to run matches between AI players of different levels and log results. ```python def simulate_matches(num_matches): for _ in range(num_matches): # Run a match and log outcomes pass ``` 2. **Log Decision-Making Processes**: - Implement logging to capture AI decisions and outcomes for analysis. ```python import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) ``` ### Step 7: Testing and Validation 1. **Test Game Logic**: - Verify that the game logic works as intended, including turn-based mechanics and win conditions. 2. **Test AI Behavior**: - Ensure that AI players behave according to their defined strategies and adapt dynamically. 3. **Error Handling**: - Implement error handling to manage unexpected inputs or actions gracefully. ### Step 8: Optional Visualization 1. **Text-Based Interface**: - Implement a simple text interface to display the game state and allow player input. 2. **Simple Visualization**: - Optionally use libraries like Pygame or Tkinter for a graphical interface. ### Step 9: Final Review and Deployment 1. **Review Code**: - Go through the code for optimization and readability. 2. **Deploy**: - Package the game if necessary and share it with others for playtesting. By following this structured plan, you can systematically develop the "Resource Wars" game as per the requirements and ensure that all aspects of the game are implemented correctly.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 15114, 'n': 1, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'schema': {'$defs': {'PlanStep': {'description': 'PlanStep model for representing a step in a plan.', 'properties': {'step_number': {'title': 'Step Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'step_name': {'title': 'Step Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_description': {'title': 'Step Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_explanation': {'title': 'Step Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_output': {'title': 'Step Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_full_text': {'title': 'Step Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['step_number', 'step_name', 'step_description', 'step_explanation', 'step_output', 'step_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'PlanStep', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'Subtask': {'description': 'Subtask model for representing a subtask in a step of a plan or another subtask.', 'properties': {'subtask_number': {'title': 'Subtask Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'subtask_description': {'title': 'Subtask Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_name': {'title': 'Subtask Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_explanation': {'title': 'Subtask Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_output': {'title': 'Subtask Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_full_text': {'title': 'Subtask Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['subtask_number', 'subtask_description', 'subtask_name', 'subtask_explanation', 'subtask_output', 'subtask_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'Subtask', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'description': 'Plan model for representing a step-by-step plan.', 'properties': {'steps': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/PlanStep'}, 'title': 'Steps', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['steps'], 'title': 'Plan', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'name': 'Plan', 'strict': True}}, 'stop': None, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Ensure that actions are valid (e.g., movement within bounds, sufficient resources for building). ```python def validate_action(action): # Check if the action is valid pass ``` ### Step 5: Dynamic Decision Making 1. **Adapt AI Strategies**: - Implement logic for AI to adapt based on the current game state and opponent actions. ```python def adapt_ai_strategy(current_state): # Analyze the state and adjust AI strategy pass ``` ### Step 6: Performance Evaluation 1. **Simulated Matches**: - Create a function to run matches between AI players of different levels and log results. ```python def simulate_matches(num_matches): for _ in range(num_matches): # Run a match and log outcomes pass ``` 2. **Log Decision-Making Processes**: - Implement logging to capture AI decisions and outcomes for analysis. ```python import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) ``` ### Step 7: Testing and Validation 1. **Test Game Logic**: - Verify that the game logic works as intended, including turn-based mechanics and win conditions. 2. **Test AI Behavior**: - Ensure that AI players behave according to their defined strategies and adapt dynamically. 3. **Error Handling**: - Implement error handling to manage unexpected inputs or actions gracefully. ### Step 8: Optional Visualization 1. **Text-Based Interface**: -

Implement a simple text interface to display the game state and allow player input. 2. **Simple Visualization**: - Optionally use libraries like Pygame or Tkinter for a graphical interface. ### Step 9: Final Review and Deployment 1. **Review Code**: - Go through the code for optimization and readability. 2. **Deploy**: - Package the game if necessary and share it with others for playtesting.
