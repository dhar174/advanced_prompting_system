AI Player Implementation:\n   - Create three levels of AI:\n     - Beginner: Makes random but valid moves.\n     - Intermediate: Uses heuristics to prioritize resource collection and basic defense.\n     - Advanced: Implements strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n3. Turn-Based Logic:\n   - Implement a turn-based system allowing each player to perform actions in sequence.\n   - Validate and execute player actions: move units, collect resources, attack opponents, or build structures.\n\n4. Dynamic Decision Making:\n   - The AI players should adapt their strategies dynamically based on the current game state, including opponent moves.\n\n5. Performance Evaluation:\n   - Run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes, decision-making processes, and overall performance for each AI.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The game may be text-based or include a simple visualization (optional).\n- Include error handling and validation to ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\nTest Success Criteria:\n- Functional game logic with turn-based mechanics.\n- AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n- Advanced AI demonstrates dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n- All winning conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\''}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 200}}

Here’s a detailed, LLM-oriented plan:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Game Board\n\n1. **Create a 10x10 Grid:**\n   - Use a 2D list to represent the game board.\n   - Initialize each cell as empty or with a specific resource.\n\n2. **Define Resource Types:**\n   - Create a class or dictionary for resources (Gold, Wood, Stone).\n   - Assign initial amounts of resources to each player.\n\n### Step 2: Implement Unit Types\n\n1. **Define Unit Classes:**\n   - Create classes for Worker, Warrior, and Builder.\n   - Each class should have attributes like position, health, and resource capacity.\n\n2. **Implement Unit Actions:**\n   - **Worker:** Method to collect resources from adjacent tiles.\n   - **Warrior:** Method to attack opponent units.\n   - **Builder:** Method to construct buildings.\n\n### Step 3: Define Building Types\n\n1. **Create Building Classes:**\n   - Implement classes for Base, Barracks, and Outpost.\n   - Each building should have attributes like health, resource storage, and unit spawn capabilities.\n\n2. **Implement Building Actions:**\n   - **Base:** Method to store resources and spawn new units.\n   - **Barracks:** Method to spawn Warriors.\n   - **Outpost:** Method to expand player control.\n\n### Step 4: Set Win Conditions\n\n1. **Define Win Conditions:**\n   - Create a function to check if a player has accumulated the required resources or eliminated all opponent bases.\n   - Implement logic to end the game when a win condition is met.\n\n### Step 5: Implement AI Player Logic\n\n1. **Create AI Classes:**\n   - Define classes for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced AI.\n   - Each class should have methods for making moves based on their strategies.\n\n2. **Implement AI Strategies:**\n   - **Beginner AI:** Randomly select valid moves.\n   - **Intermediate AI:** Use heuristics to prioritize resource collection and defense.\n   - **Advanced AI:** Implement Minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategic planning.\n\n### Step 6: Develop Turn-Based Logic\n\n1. **Create a Turn Management System:**\n   - Implement a function to manage turns for each player.\n   - Validate player actions (moving units, collecting resources, attacking, building).\n\n2. **Execute Player Actions:**\n   - Based on player input, call the appropriate methods for unit actions.\n\n### Step 7: Dynamic Decision Making\n\n1. **Adapt AI Strategies:**\n   - Implement a system for AI players to assess the current game state.\n   - Adjust AI behavior based on opponent moves and resource availability.\n\n### Step 8: Performance Evaluation\n\n1. **Simulate Matches:**\n   - Create a function to run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes and decision-making processes for analysis.\n\n2. **Evaluate AI Performance:**\n   - Analyze logs to assess the effectiveness of AI strategies.\n   - Adjust AI behavior based on performance results.\n\n### Step 9: Error Handling and Validation\n\n1. **Implement Error Handling:**\n   - Ensure robust gameplay mechanics by handling invalid moves and unexpected inputs.\n   - Validate resource collection, unit movements, and building actions.\n\n### Step 10: Visualization (Optional)\n\n1. **Text-Based or Simple Visualization:**\n   - Implement a text-based interface to display the game state.\n   - Optionally, create a simple graphical representation using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter.\n\n### Step 11: Testing\n\n1. **Test Game Functionality:**\n   - Verify that all game rules and win conditions are enforced correctly.\n   - Test individual components (units, buildings, AI) for expected behavior.\n\n2. **Test AI Behavior:**\n   - Ensure AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n   - Test the advanced AI for dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n\n### Step 12: Documentation\n\n1. **Document Code:**\n   - Write comments and documentation for each class and function.\n   - Include instructions for running the game and any dependencies.\n\n### Step 13: Final Review\n\n1. **Review Code:**\n   - Conduct a thorough review of the code for efficiency and readability.\n   - Make any necessary optimizations or improvements based on testing results.\n\nBy following this step-by-step plan, you can systematically develop the "Resource Wars" game, ensuring that all requirements are met and that the gameplay experience is engaging and robust.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 14766, 'n': 1, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'schema': {'$defs': {'PlanStep': {'description': 'PlanStep model for representing a step in a plan.', 'properties': {'step_number': {'title': 'Step Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'completed': {'title': 'Completed', 'type': 'boolean'}, 'step_name': {'title': 'Step Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_description': {'title': 'Step Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_explanation': {'title': 'Step Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_output': {'title': 'Step Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_full_text': {'title': 'Step Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['step_number', 'completed', 'step_name', 'step_description', 'step_explanation', 'step_output', 'step_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'PlanStep', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'Subtask': {'description': 'Subtask model for representing a subtask in a step of a plan or another subtask.', 'properties': {'subtask_number': {'title': 'Subtask Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'completed': {'title': 'Completed', 'type': 'boolean'}, 'subtask_description': {'title': 'Subtask Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_name': {'title': 'Subtask Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_explanation': {'title': 'Subtask Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_output': {'title': 'Subtask Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_full_text': {'title': 'Subtask Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['subtask_number', 'completed', 'subtask_description', 'subtask_name', 'subtask_explanation', 'subtask_output', 'subtask_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'Subtask', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'description': 'Plan model for representing a step-by-step plan.', 'properties': {'steps': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/PlanStep'}, 'title': 'Steps', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['steps'], 'title': 'Plan', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'name': 'Plan', 'strict': True}}, 'stop': None, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.30000000000000004}}

The script must accomplish the following tasks:\n\nGame Requirements:\n\n1. Game Board and Rules:\n   - Create a 10x10 grid-based game board.\n   - Define three types of resources: Gold, Wood, and Stone.\n   - Implement the following unit types:\n     - Worker: Collects resources from adjacent tiles.\n     - Warrior: Attacks opponent units.\n     - Builder: Constructs buildings.\n   - Define building types:\n     - Base: Stores resources and spawns new units.\n     - Barracks: Spawns Warriors.\n     - Outpost: Expands player control.\n   - Set the win conditions:\n     - Accumulate a predefined amount of each resource.\n     - Eliminate all opponent bases.\n\n2. AI Player Implementation:\n   - Create three levels of AI:\n     - Beginner: Makes random but valid moves.\n     - Intermediate: Uses heuristics to prioritize resource collection and basic defense.\n     - Advanced: Implements strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n3. Turn-Based Logic:\n   - Implement a turn-based system allowing each player to perform actions in sequence.\n   - Validate and execute player actions: move units, collect resources, attack opponents, or build structures.\n\n4. Dynamic Decision Making:\n   - The AI players should adapt their strategies dynamically based on the current game state, including opponent moves.\n\n5. Performance Evaluation:\n   - Run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes, decision-making processes, and overall performance for each AI.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The game may be text-based or include a simple visualization (optional).\n- Include error handling and validation to ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\nTest Success Criteria:\n- Functional game logic with turn-based mechanics.\n- AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n- Advanced AI demonstrates dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n- All winning conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\''}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 150, 'n': 1, 'stop': None, 'temperature': 0.7}}

Game Board and Rules:\n   - Create a 10x10 grid-based game board.\n   - Define three types of resources: Gold, Wood, and Stone.\n   - Implement the following unit types:\n     - Worker: Collects resources from adjacent tiles.\n     - Warrior: Attacks opponent units.\n     - Builder: Constructs buildings.\n   - Define building types:\n     - Base: Stores resources and spawns new units.\n     - Barracks: Spawns Warriors.\n     - Outpost: Expands player control.\n   - Set the win conditions:\n     - Accumulate a predefined amount of each resource.\n     - Eliminate all opponent bases.\n\n2. AI Player Implementation:\n   - Create three levels of AI:\n     - Beginner: Makes random but valid moves.\n     - Intermediate: Uses heuristics to prioritize resource collection and basic defense.\n     - Advanced: Implements strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n3. Turn-Based Logic:\n   - Implement a turn-based system allowing each player to perform actions in sequence.\n   - Validate and execute player actions: move units, collect resources, attack opponents, or build structures.\n\n4. Dynamic Decision Making:\n   - The AI players should adapt their strategies dynamically based on the current game state, including opponent moves.\n\n5. Performance Evaluation:\n   - Run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes, decision-making processes, and overall performance for each AI.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The game may be text-based or include a simple visualization (optional).\n- Include error handling and validation to ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\nTest Success Criteria:\n- Functional game logic with turn-based mechanics.\n- AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n- Advanced AI demonstrates dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n- All winning conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\'\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "You are an advanced AI designed to solve problems systematically and thoroughly.

This will involve creating classes for the game board, resources, units, and buildings. \n\nI will also need to consider how to structure the AI and the turn-based logic in subsequent steps. \n\nNow, I will proceed to define the game board and the resources.\n\n<step>Define a class `GameBoard` that initializes a 10x10 grid and a method to display the board.

I can use different characters or symbols to represent empty tiles, resources, and units. For example, I could use '.' for empty tiles, 'G' for Gold, 'W' for Wood, 'S' for Stone, and specific letters for different unit types.\n\nIn the `Resource` class, I will implement methods like `add_resource` and `subtract_resource` to manage the quantities effectively. I should also consider adding a method to get the current resource quantities for easy access.\n\nOnce these classes are implemented, I can move on to defining the unit types and their interactions with the game board and resources.

The next step is to define the unit types: Worker, Warrior, and Builder. Each unit will have specific attributes and methods that define their behavior in the game.\n\n1. **Worker**: This unit will be responsible for collecting resources from adjacent tiles. It will need a method to move to a tile and collect resources if available.\n2. **Warrior**: This unit will attack opponent units. It will require methods for moving to an opponent's location and executing an attack.\n3. **Builder**: This unit will construct buildings. It will need methods to move to a location and build structures like Bases, Barracks, and Outposts.\n\nI will create a base class for units to encapsulate common attributes and methods, such as position and movement, and then derive the specific unit types from this base class. This will promote code reuse and maintainability.\n\n<step>Define a base class `Unit` with common attributes and methods for position and movement.

This will involve accessing the `GameBoard` to determine what resources are present.\n- The `Warrior` class will require a method to determine if an opponent is within attack range and to execute the attack, which will involve reducing the opponent's health or removing them from the board.\n- The `Builder` class will need to check if the player has enough resources before constructing a building and will update the game state accordingly.\n\nI will also need to think about how to manage the state of the game board as units perform actions, ensuring that resources are updated and units are moved correctly.\n\n<step>Implement the `Unit` class with methods for movement and position validation.
