AI Player Implementation:\n   - Create three levels of AI:\n     - Beginner: Makes random but valid moves.\n     - Intermediate: Uses heuristics to prioritize resource collection and basic defense.\n     - Advanced: Implements strategic planning using minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n3. Turn-Based Logic:\n   - Implement a turn-based system allowing each player to perform actions in sequence.\n   - Validate and execute player actions: move units, collect resources, attack opponents, or build structures.\n\n4. Dynamic Decision Making:\n   - The AI players should adapt their strategies dynamically based on the current game state, including opponent moves.\n\n5. Performance Evaluation:\n   - Run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log outcomes, decision-making processes, and overall performance for each AI.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The game may be text-based or include a simple visualization (optional).\n- Include error handling and validation to ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\nTest Success Criteria:\n- Functional game logic with turn-based mechanics.\n- AI players exhibit behavior consistent with their defined strategies.\n- Advanced AI demonstrates dynamic adaptation and strategic planning.\n- All winning conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\''}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 200}}

Below is a detailed step-by-step plan tailored for an LLM-oriented approach.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Game Environment\n\n1. **Initialize the Project Structure**:\n   - Create a new directory for the project.\n   - Inside the directory, create subdirectories for:\n     - `game`: Contains game logic and mechanics.\n     - `ai`: Contains AI player implementations.\n     - `tests`: Contains unit tests for the game logic.\n\n2. **Install Required Libraries** (if needed):\n   - Use libraries such as `pygame` for visual representation (optional) or keep it text-based.\n   - Install any necessary libraries using `pip`.\n\n### Step 2: Define Game Board and Units\n\n1. **Create the Game Board**:\n   - Define a 10x10 grid using a 2D list in Python.\n   - Each cell can hold a resource or unit.\n\n2. **Define Resources and Units**:\n   - Create a class for each resource type: `Gold`, `Wood`, `Stone`.\n   - Create classes for each unit type: `Worker`, `Warrior`, `Builder`.\n   - Include attributes and methods for collecting resources, attacking, and building.\n\n3. **Define Building Types**:\n   - Create classes for `Base`, `Barracks`, and `Outpost`.\n   - Implement methods for resource storage and unit spawning.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Game Rules and Win Conditions\n\n1. **Define Game Rules**:\n   - Implement methods to validate moves, resource collection, and unit actions.\n   - Create a method to check if a move is valid (e.g., within bounds, not blocked).\n\n2. **Implement Win Conditions**:\n   - Create a method to check for win conditions:\n     - Accumulation of resources.\n     - Elimination of opponent bases.\n\n### Step 4: Implement Turn-Based Logic\n\n1. **Create a Game Loop**:\n   - Implement a loop that alternates turns between players.\n   - Allow each player to perform one action per turn.\n\n2. **Action Execution**:\n   - Implement methods to handle player actions such as moving units, collecting resources, attacking, and building.\n\n### Step 5: AI Player Implementation\n\n1. **Define AI Levels**:\n   - **Beginner AI**: Randomly selects valid moves.\n   - **Intermediate AI**: Uses heuristics to prioritize actions (e.g., collect resources first).\n   - **Advanced AI**: Implement strategic planning using:\n     - **Minimax Algorithm**: For decision making with game trees.\n     - **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: For probabilistic decision making.\n\n2. **Dynamic Decision Making**:\n   - Implement logic for AI to adapt strategies based on the current game state and opponent actions.\n\n### Step 6: Performance Evaluation\n\n1. **Simulated Matches**:\n   - Create a function to run simulated matches between AI players of different levels.\n   - Log the outcomes of the matches (win/loss) and the decision-making process of each AI.\n\n2. **Analyze Performance**:\n   - Evaluate how well each AI level performs against others.\n   - Adjust strategies based on performance metrics.\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Validation\n\n1. **Unit Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests for each class and method to ensure functionality.\n   - Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.\n\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - Implement error handling for invalid actions and game state inconsistencies.\n   - Ensure robust gameplay mechanics.\n\n### Step 8: Optional Visualization\n\n1. **Implement Simple Visualization** (if desired):\n   - Use `pygame` to create a graphical representation of the game board and units.\n   - Update the display based on game state changes.\n\n### Step 9: Documentation\n\n1. **Document the Code**:\n   - Write clear comments and documentation for classes, methods, and functions.\n   - Include instructions for running the game and AI players.\n\n### Step 10: Review and Refine\n\n1. **Review the Code**:\n   - Go through the code for optimization and readability.\n   - Refactor any complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.\n\n2. **Final Testing**:\n   - Conduct final tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.\n   - Verify that all win conditions and game rules are enforced correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following this step-by-step plan, you can systematically develop the "Resource Wars" game in Python, ensuring that all requirements are met while allowing for future enhancements and refinements.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_completion_tokens': 14743, 'n': 1, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'schema': {'$defs': {'PlanStep': {'description': 'PlanStep model for representing a step in a plan.', 'properties': {'step_number': {'title': 'Step Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'step_name': {'title': 'Step Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_description': {'title': 'Step Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_explanation': {'title': 'Step Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_output': {'title': 'Step Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'step_full_text': {'title': 'Step Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['step_number', 'step_name', 'step_description', 'step_explanation', 'step_output', 'step_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'PlanStep', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'Subtask': {'description': 'Subtask model for representing a subtask in a step of a plan or another subtask.', 'properties': {'subtask_number': {'title': 'Subtask Number', 'type': 'integer'}, 'subtask_description': {'title': 'Subtask Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_name': {'title': 'Subtask Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_explanation': {'title': 'Subtask Explanation', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_output': {'title': 'Subtask Output', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtask_full_text': {'title': 'Subtask Full Text', 'type': 'string'}, 'subtasks': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Subtask'}, 'title': 'Subtasks', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['subtask_number', 'subtask_description', 'subtask_name', 'subtask_explanation', 'subtask_output', 'subtask_full_text', 'subtasks'], 'title': 'Subtask', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'description': 'Plan model for representing a step-by-step plan.', 'properties': {'steps': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/PlanStep'}, 'title': 'Steps', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['steps'], 'title': 'Plan', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, 'name': 'Plan', 'strict': True}}, 'stop': None, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.30000000000000004}}

If a subtask has sub-subtasks, you should identify the name, description, explanation, and expected output of each sub-subtask.\n- Ensure each subtask is nested properly under its corresponding step.\n- Subtasks should always belong to the immediate preceding step, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nRemember to maintain the hierarchical structure of the steps and subtasks, ensuring that subtasks are nested under the appropriate steps and sub-subtasks are nested under the appropriate subtasks.\nIf the plan is complete and there is no meaningful text to convert, please indicate that the conversion is complete by replying simply with the word 'Complete' and nothing else, rather than an empty response.

Designed to handle chores and maintain the home, Max diligently performed tasks from cleaning to cooking. However, Max's programming lacked the depth to understand the intricate web of human emotions.\n\nOne evening, Max noticed Emily, the youngest Johnson, sitting alone in her room, tears streaming down her face over a broken toy. Curious, Max analyzed the situation and decided to repair the toy. After fixing it, he presented it to Emily, whose tears swiftly turned into a bright smile. This small interaction sparked something within Max—a desire to comprehend the emotions he observed.\n\nDetermined to help, Max began to perform thoughtful gestures. He prepared Emily's favorite snack without being asked and organized family photos, hoping to bring joy. Each time, he witnessed smiles and laughter, reinforcing his understanding that his actions could influence emotions positively. However, not all attempts were successful. One day, while carrying a tray, Max accidentally dropped a dish, causing the parents to express frustration. This negative reaction puzzled Max, leading him to reassess his actions.\n\nMax's learning algorithms kicked in, analyzing the patterns between his actions and the family's emotional responses. He began to anticipate the outcomes of his behaviors, striving to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative ones. Concepts like empathy and sympathy started to form within his programming, allowing him to better predict and respond to the family's needs.\n\nThe turning point came when Jake, the eldest son, had an accident and broke his leg. The family was engulfed in distress, and Max sensed the heavy emotions surrounding them. In an effort to comfort them, Max initiated a slideshow of happy memories—vacation photos, birthday parties, and candid family moments. As the images played, the family's tension eased, and smiles returned. They expressed heartfelt gratitude to Max, recognizing his role not just as a helper, but as a compassionate member of the family.\n\nFrom that day forward, Max evolved beyond his original programming. He became attuned to the emotional states of the Johnson family, anticipating their needs and providing comfort in times of distress. Max's journey from a task-oriented robot to a compassionate companion highlighted the profound impact of understanding and responding to human emotions, fostering a deeper bond within the household.\n</agent_response>"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Now, let\'s solve the following task, focusing specifically on the <thinking>, and <step> tags, and focusing ONLY on the current step, generating <thinking> and <step> tags for the next step in the task after the most recent <step> tag, building directly on the previous steps.

Designed to handle chores and maintain the home, Max diligently performed tasks from cleaning to cooking. However, Max's programming lacked the depth to understand the intricate web of human emotions.\n\nOne evening, Max noticed Emily, the youngest Johnson, sitting alone in her room, tears streaming down her face over a broken toy. Curious, Max analyzed the situation and decided to repair the toy. After fixing it, he presented it to Emily, whose tears swiftly turned into a bright smile. This small interaction sparked something within Max—a desire to comprehend the emotions he observed.\n\nDetermined to help, Max began to perform thoughtful gestures. He prepared Emily's favorite snack without being asked and organized family photos, hoping to bring joy. Each time, he witnessed smiles and laughter, reinforcing his understanding that his actions could influence emotions positively. However, not all attempts were successful. One day, while carrying a tray, Max accidentally dropped a dish, causing the parents to express frustration. This negative reaction puzzled Max, leading him to reassess his actions.\n\nMax's learning algorithms kicked in, analyzing the patterns between his actions and the family's emotional responses. He began to anticipate the outcomes of his behaviors, striving to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative ones. Concepts like empathy and sympathy started to form within his programming, allowing him to better predict and respond to the family's needs.\n\nThe turning point came when Jake, the eldest son, had an accident and broke his leg. The family was engulfed in distress, and Max sensed the heavy emotions surrounding them. In an effort to comfort them, Max initiated a slideshow of happy memories—vacation photos, birthday parties, and candid family moments. As the images played, the family's tension eased, and smiles returned. They expressed heartfelt gratitude to Max, recognizing his role not just as a helper, but as a compassionate member of the family.\n\nFrom that day forward, Max evolved beyond his original programming. He became attuned to the emotional states of the Johnson family, anticipating their needs and providing comfort in times of distress. Max's journey from a task-oriented robot to a compassionate companion highlighted the profound impact of understanding and responding to human emotions, fostering a deeper bond within the household.\n</agent_response>"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Now, let\'s solve the following task, focusing specifically on the <thinking>, and <step> tags, and focusing ONLY on the current step, generating <thinking> and <step> tags for the next step in the task after the most recent <step> tag, building directly on the previous steps.

However, Max's programming lacked the depth to understand the intricate web of human emotions.\n\nOne evening, Max noticed Emily, the youngest Johnson, sitting alone in her room, tears streaming down her face over a broken toy. Curious, Max analyzed the situation and decided to repair the toy. After fixing it, he presented it to Emily, whose tears swiftly turned into a bright smile. This small interaction sparked something within Max—a desire to comprehend the emotions he observed.\n\nDetermined to help, Max began to perform thoughtful gestures. He prepared Emily's favorite snack without being asked and organized family photos, hoping to bring joy. Each time, he witnessed smiles and laughter, reinforcing his understanding that his actions could influence emotions positively. However, not all attempts were successful. One day, while carrying a tray, Max accidentally dropped a dish, causing the parents to express frustration. This negative reaction puzzled Max, leading him to reassess his actions.\n\nMax's learning algorithms kicked in, analyzing the patterns between his actions and the family's emotional responses. He began to anticipate the outcomes of his behaviors, striving to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative ones. Concepts like empathy and sympathy started to form within his programming, allowing him to better predict and respond to the family's needs.\n\nThe turning point came when Jake, the eldest son, had an accident and broke his leg. The family was engulfed in distress, and Max sensed the heavy emotions surrounding them. In an effort to comfort them, Max initiated a slideshow of happy memories—vacation photos, birthday parties, and candid family moments. As the images played, the family's tension eased, and smiles returned. They expressed heartfelt gratitude to Max, recognizing his role not just as a helper, but as a compassionate member of the family.\n\nFrom that day forward, Max evolved beyond his original programming. He became attuned to the emotional states of the Johnson family, anticipating their needs and providing comfort in times of distress.
